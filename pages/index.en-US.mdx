# Clash Verge

Clash Verge is an open source cross-platform proxy client developed based on the Tauri framework, supporting Windows, macOS and Linux systems. It inherits the core functions of Clash and integrates the continuously updated ​Clash.Meta (mihomo) kernel, supporting Shadowsocks (SS), ShadowsocksR (SSR), Socks, Snell, V2Ray, Trojan, VLESS, Reality and other proxy protocols.

## Why Use Clash Verge?

- Multi-platform support: Clash Verge is available for Windows, macOS and Linux, ensuring that users of different operating systems can experience efficient network services.
- ​Multi-protocol support: Compatible with traditional protocols such as Shadowsocks, Vmess, Trojan, and supports new protocols such as VLESS and Reality (requires Meta kernel).
-​ Lightweight design: The installation package is small in size, low in resource usage, and higher security is achieved through the Tauri framework.
- System proxy guard: Regularly detect and reset the system proxy to prevent other programs from tampering with settings.
- ​ TUN mode: Take over global traffic through the virtual network card and force all applications to go through the proxy (service components need to be installed).
- ​ User-friendly interface: Supports English, Simplified Chinese, dark mode and custom themes, and the operation logic refers to classic clients such as Clash for Windows.

## Core functions
- ​Configuration file management​: supports configuration file merging and scripting, and enhances the functions of Profiles;
