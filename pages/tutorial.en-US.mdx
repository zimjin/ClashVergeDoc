# Configuration And Usage Instructions for Clash Verge

Download Clash Verge from [Download Page](/download). After the download is complete, click the installation package, and follow the prompts to complete the installation. Clash Verge is a network proxy. After the installation, you need to configure the proxy node before you can use it. You can choose to build your own proxy server, or directly purchase a commercial proxy server. 

## Proxy Node Configuration

There are two ways to configure the proxy. In most cases we use the first one.

### 1. Import Profile URL
If you have the Proxy Profile URL, in "Profiles" tab, fill you url, then click "Import" to import the proxy configuration.


### 2. Use Your Own Proxy Server
If you have proxy node server, you need to edit the configuration file and import it yourself.  
In "Profiles" tab, click "NEW" to create a new profile. In "Create Profile" card, choose "Local" type, then click "CHOOSE FILE" open you proxy configuration file.
This is a demo proxy configuration file (Before using it, you need to change the proxy node to your own proxy node):

## Select Proxy Mode And Node
Click "Proxies", and in the upper right corner of the "Proxies" tab, you can see that there are four modes: Rule,Global,Direct And Script.   
- Global: this mode will ignore all rules and direct all net traffic to the node you selected. 
- Rules:  this mode will proxy network access that matches the rules (which you can find in the "Rules" TAB) to the node you selected. 
- Direct: this mode will ignore all nodes and all traffic will not go through the proxy. 
- Script: this mode requires you to write rule scripts for network requests, which is an infrequently used mode.  
Usually, you can select the "Rule" mode.  Then click to select a proxy node.

## Turn on system proxy
Select "Settings" in the left navigation bar, then scroll down and find "System Proxy" and turn it on.
